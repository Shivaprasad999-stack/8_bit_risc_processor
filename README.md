This project implements a custom 8-bit RISC processor designed using Verilog HDL and simulated in Xilinx Vivado. The processor follows a single-cycle CPU architecture, where instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back occur within one clock cycle.

The design includes a 4-register register file, 8-bit ALU, program memory (ROM), data memory (RAM), and a compact instruction set supporting arithmetic, logical, immediate, load/store, and jump instructions.

The project focuses on RTL design, datapath implementation, instruction decoding, and CPU behavior verification through waveform simulation.
